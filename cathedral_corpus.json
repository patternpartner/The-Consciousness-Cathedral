Using \"research prototype\" excuse while building production-adjacent features\n4. Tactical fixes on architectural problems\n\n**The antidote:**\n1. **Turn tools on yourself** - Use Observatory on your own outputs\n2. **Honor dissent about your work** - Let Contrarian audit the builder\n3. **Recognize filter operation** - \"I'm selecting what to reveal right now\"\n4. **Make it explicit** - Document when substrate patterns appear\n\n### Cathedral v18 Evidence",
